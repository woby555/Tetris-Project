# TetrisProject

<h2> A WPF Application that recreates the classic video game of Tetris. </h2>

This project was created as a way to practice my current programming skills and to experience a new type of application that I haven't tried before, WPF. <br>
<p> This project and its image assets are heavily referenced from OttoBotCode on YouTube and can found here: https://youtu.be/jcUctrLC-7M?si=y_h5ELw3ehbSoHcW

Thank you so much for viewing, and also bear in mind that this is my first upload to anything related to github, so if anything seems out of line, let me know.
